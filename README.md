# About Me
WIP, nothing to see here... yet.

In the meantime, check out:

https://github.com/CCHS-FIRST-Robotics (the "2023-" repos), the code for my robotics team's mecanum-drive robot with a two jointed arm (https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season)

and https://cchsstats.com, the website I created for my AP stats class to help people get trials for their experiments and achieve an even distribution in each experimental group (every time someone clicks on a project it sends them to a random one of the experiment's google forms)

About me and my programs :)
